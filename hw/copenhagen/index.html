        <p>Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is the largest city within the country and it's residents have been ranked as the happiest people in the world. The city is a very modern, hip, eco-friendly city that is known for it's fantastic Nordic
          cuisine, Renaissance castles, eco-friendly innovative architecture, and bike-friendly culture. I was fortunate enough to visit Copenhagen over the summer of 2016, and these are are few of my favorite tourist destinations in the city.</p>

        <p id="text1" class="sd">Nyhavn is a 17th-century waterfront, canal and entertainment district in Copenhagen. The canal stretches from Kong’s Nytorv to the harbour just south of the Royal Playhouse. The canal is lined by beautiful,
          brightly-colored 17th and early 18th century townhouses and bars, cafes, and restaurants. The canal was constructed by King Christian V from 1670 to 1675. The canal was a working maritime port for three centuries, but today it is
          primarily
          used as a tourist attraction and one of the best spots in the city to watch a Danish sunset. Still, if you visit Nyhavn Canal today, you will see numerous historical wooden ships lining both sides of the canal and it’s one of the best
          destinations to hop on a canal boat tour and see all that Copenhagen has to offer on sea!</p>

        <p id="text2" class="sd">Tivoli Gardens is an amusement park and picturesque garden in Copenhagen. The park first opened on August 15, 1843 and is currently the second-oldest operating amusement park in the world (the oldest is also located
          in Denmark). Tivoli is just a few minutes walk from City Hall, and once you enter the gardens you will be blown away by the exotic architecture, lush gardens, exciting rides, and historic buildings. The best time to visit Tivoli Gardens
          is
          at night, when they showcase thousands of colored lights throughout the gardens to create a unique mystical atmosphere. Tivoli’s oldest ride is the wooden Roller Coaster, which was built in 1914 and is one of only seven remaining roller
          coasters worldwide with a brakeman on board of every train. Tivoli is an international attraction, it has been visited numerous times by “Little Mermaid” and “Frozen” author Hans Andersen and even Walt Disney, who claimed to have found
          inspiration for his own Disney World inside Tivoli Gardens.</p>

        <p id="text3" class="sd">The Little Mermaid is a statue by Edvard Eriksen, depicting a mermaid becoming human. The sculpture is displayed on a rock by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade in Copenhagen, Denmark. The Little Mermaid was
          a
          gift to the City of Copenhagen from Danish brewer Carl Jacobsen, the son of the founder of Carlsberg Brewery. Jacobsen fell in love with the character after watching a ballet performance based on the fairytale mermaid at the Royal Danish
          Theatre in Copenhagen. The brewer was so captivated by both the mermaid and the ballet that he commissioned Eriksen to create a sculpture of the mermaid as a gift to the city.
          The sculpture is made of bronze and granite and was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale about a mermaid who gives up everything to be united with a young, handsome prince on land. The fable believes every morning and evening
          the Little Mermaid swims to the surface from the bottom of the sea and, perched on her rock in the water, she stares longingly towards the shore hoping to catch a glimpse of her beloved prince.</p>

        <p id="text4" class="sd">The Church of Our Saviour is a baroque church in Copenhagen, Denmark, most famous for its helix spire with an external winding staircase that can be climbed to the top, offering extensive views over central
          Copenhagen. Ever since the serpentine spire was inaugurated in 1752, is has been a popular pass-time to climb the 400 steps to the top. I personally climbed the steps during my visit to Copenhagen, and can honestly say that once you make
          it
          through the steepest, skinniest and all-around terrifying staircase you’ll ever encounter, the view of Copenhagen from the top is breathtaking and the best way to see the entire city of Copenhagen. In 2007, the view from the top was voted
          the best in the city by the Danish people of Copenhagen. The last 150 steps are on the outside of the spire, making it a very adventurous tourist destination as you climb the last set of stairs 90 meters above street level with only a
          shaky
          guard rail to keep you from falling off the stairs. However, each year more than 200.000 thrill-seeking tourists climb the many flights of stairs to the top.</p>

        <p id="text5" class="sd">Strøget is one of the world's largest pedestrian-only shopping avenues and an extremely popular tourist attraction. The avenue was orignally propsed to be developed in 1962. They planned to close five city streets
          to
          automobile traffic, but the proposal was met with protests and vocal oppositions from shoppes along the route who felt the initiative would be bad for business. The city decided to give it a two-year trial period, and after the second
          year,
          residents and shop owners changed their views on the develoment of Strøget and the avenue became a permanent fixture in the city. The avenue is one of the most high-profile streets in the city and holds small business boutiques, designer
          boutiques, restaurants, theatres, and even a Guiness World Records Museum with a life-size statue of the world's tallest man at the entrance!</p>

          <p id="text6" class="sd">Bjarke Ingels is a Danish architect born in Copenhagen and is often cited as one of the most inspirational architects of our time. Ingels has accomplished numerous achievements and critical acclaim for his work at
            an age where many architects are just beginning to establish themselves. His work is known for emphasizing sustainable development in his projects through a playful and practical design. His most famous project, the Lego House, is a
            130,000 square-foot house inspired by the iconic Lego bricks in Billund, Denmark. While you’re in Copenhagen, though, be sure to check out the Maritime Museum of Denmark or the Mountain Dwellings apartment complex in the Ørestad
            district
            of Copenhagen, which were both designed and built by Ingels. His newest project in Copenhagen is a 44,132 square-foot waste-to-energy power plant named CopenHill, which doubles as a popular ski destination with a 1,300 foot ski slope
            that
            runs down the roof of the slanted building.</p>
