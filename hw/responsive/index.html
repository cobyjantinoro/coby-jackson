      <h1 class="title">Why The Rookies?</h1>
      <p>As fans, once the season ends, we care so much about what pick we have in the upcoming draft because we know that's where championships begin, and it's sometimes where they're made. Why is that? because every year, hundreds of the most
        talented athletes in sports like ice hockey, basketball, and football are finally given the chance to live out there lifelong dream of becoming a professional athlete for a living. As we reach the end of the decade and prepare for the
        next one, we also must prepare for a new generation of athletes who will replace the names of greats like Sidney Crosby, Stephen Curry, and Tom Brady in the record books. These are a few players who I believe have the potential to be the
        next big names in sports.</p>

          <h3>Jack Hughes</h3>
          <p>Jack Hughes has been regarded as the next big thing to hit the NHL long before he was even drafted. Jack was named the #1 prospect in the NHL draft two years in a row, and after his brother, Quinn, was drafted by the Vancouver
            Canucks in 2018, a lot of hype started to build around the dynamic player. He was drafted first overall by the New Jersey Devils in 2019, a team who recently also acquired the former MVP, Taylor Hall and a Norris Trophy winning
            defenseman and fiance to Lindsey Vonn, P.K Subban. Hockey fans rave about Jack's game because he has an extremely high hockey I.Q at the young age of 18. Jack is also one of the fastest skaters hockey scouts have ever seen, and his
            speed allowed him to forgo NCAA hockey and enter the NHL after high school. While he may need a year or two in order to cause serious damage in the league, expect Jack Hughes to be a household name in the next decade.</p>

          <h3>Tyler Herro</h3>
          <p>It's hard to be talked about as the next big thing in the NBA when you're in the same draft class as players like Zion Williamson and R.J Barrett, but that didn't fear Tyler Herro one bit. The 19 year-old was drafted thirteenth in
            the 2019 NBA Draft to the Miami Heat, and has recognized he is in an excellent position to potentially fill the hearts of fans who recently were force to say farewell to Heat legend, Dwayne Wade. Tyler Herro is a supremely confident
            shot-maker who can get to his jumper in a variety of ways, hunts scoring opportunities in the open court with great instincts, and plays with a competitive streak defensively. Expect his skill and work-ethic to impress a lot more
            people than many expected.</p>

          <h3>Daniel Jones</h3>
          <p>When Giants fans heard Daniel Jones name picked sixth overall by the team in last year's draft, they went nuts, but for all the wrong reasons. Who? Fans were perplexed the Giants' would take such an average prospect at such a high
            position, but the Giants saw something in him that would eventually cause Giants fans everywhere to completely eat their words and change their thoughts. This past September, long-time Giants quarterback Eli Manning lost the starting
            job to Jones for their game in Tampa Bay against the Buccaneers. Jones and the Giants Giants overcame an 18-point halftime deficit, the loss of two of their captains to first-half injuries (running back Saquon Barkley – ankle and
            linebacker Alec Ogletree – hamstring), and the 22-year-old was responsible for all four Giants touchdowns, two passing and two rushing (plus a throw for a two-point conversion). The last was a fourth-down, seven-yard scamper that gave
            the Giants their first lead of the game with 1:16 remaining. It was then that the whole league knew they had a completely different quarterback on their hands then they thought. While it's still early, expect Daniel Jones to be the
            new king of New York for years to come.</p>

          <p>I see Jack becoming a top 6 player in the NHL within 5 years, potentially winning at least 1 Stanley Cup in that time with this Devils Team they currently have. Within 7 years, I expect Jack Hughes to be the highest-paid player in
            the NHL.</p>
